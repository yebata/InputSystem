Q: What is this?
A: This is a additional test to the New Input System.
   It includes keyboard, mouse, xbox controller, pen and newly added touch. 
   It also comes with a generic diagram for other gamepads.

Q: Who made this?
   This is made by @jia. 
   Please email me any comment/concern or poke me in Slack directly.

Q: How to use this?
   Go to folder: Input_Test -> Scenes and open the scene in there.
   Since the new Input System does not support the UI element yet, I suggest use this with the old Input Manager.
   The setting can be changed at: Player Settings -> Other Settings -> Active Input Handling

Q: Why are there so many scripts for Old Input Manager?
   Because the goal is to test both old and new input together at the same time. 

Q: There are so much going on at the same time! I don't know what I'm looking at...
A: Generally speaking, anything blue is for the Old Input Manager, and the other red things are for the New Input System.
   For example: if a message shows up in blue font, it is related to the Old Input Manager.
